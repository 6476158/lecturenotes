### What is discrete mathematics? 

Discrete mathematics is the part of mathematics devoted to the study of discrete objects. (Here discrete means consisting of distinct or unconnected elements.) The kinds of problems solved using discrete mathematics include:

 - How many ways are there to choose a valid password on a computer system?
 - What is the probability of winning a lottery?
 - Is there a link between two computers in a network?
 - How can I identify spam e-mail messages?
 - How can I encrypt a message so that no unintended recipient can read it?
 - What is the shortest path between two cities using a transportation system?
 - How can a list of integers be sorted so that the integers are in increasing order?
 - How many steps are required to do such a sorting?
 - How can it be proved that a sorting algorithm correctly sorts a list?
 - How can a circuit that adds two integers be designed?
 - How many valid Internet addresses are there?
 
More generally, discrete mathematics is used whenever objects are counted, when relationships between ﬁnite (or countable) sets are studied, and when processes involving a ﬁnite number of steps are analyzed. A key reason for the growth in the importance of discrete mathematics is that information is stored and manipulated by computing machines in a discrete fashion.

### Summary

  - The rules of logic specify the meaning of mathematical statements.To understand mathematics, we must understand what makes up a correct mathematical argument, that is, a proof. Once we prove a mathematical statement is true, we call it a theorem. Proofs are used to verify that computer programs produce the correct output for all possible input values, to show that algorithms always produce the correct result, to establish the security of a system, and to create artiﬁcial intelligence. Furthermore, automated reasoning systems have been created to allow computers to construct their own proofs. The rules of logic give precise meaning to mathematical statements. These rules are used to distinguish between valid and invalid mathematical arguments.
  
  - The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the propositional calculus or propositional logic.
