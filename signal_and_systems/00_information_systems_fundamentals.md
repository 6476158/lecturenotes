Informatics
======
Informatics is the study of the structure, behaviour, and interactions of natural and engineered computational systems. The term informatics broadly describes the study and practise of creating, storing, finding, manipulating and sharing information. Another definition, The term informatics broadly describes the study and practice of creating, storing, finding, manipulating and sharing information.

## Etymology of Informatics
In 1956 the German computer scientist Karl Steinbuch coined the word Informatik
> [ Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung ("Informatics:
Automatic Information Processing")]

The French term informatique was coined in
1962 by Philippe Dreyfus
> [Dreyfus, Phillipe. L’informatique. Gestion, Paris, June 1962, pp.
240–41]

The term was coined as a combination of information and automatic to describe the science of automating information interactions

Data - Information - Knowledge
======
## Data
unprocessed facts and figures without any added interpretation or analysis. 

 {The price of crude oil is $80 per barrel.}

## Information
data that has been interpreted so that it has meaning for the user.

{The price of crude oil has risen from $70 to $80 per barrel}
> [gives meaning to the data and so is said to be information to someone who tracks oil prices.]

## Knowledge
a combination of information , experience and insight that may benefit the individual or the organisation.

{When crude oil prices go up by $10 per barrel, it's likely that petrol prices will rise by 2p per litre.}
>[ insight : the capacity to gain an accurate and deep understanding of someone or something; an accurate and deep understanding]

## Converting data into information
![Semantic description of image](https://image.ibb.co/g11YPf/test.png)

- Data becomes information when it is applied to some purpose and adds value for the recipient.

>### For example a set of raw sales figures is data .
>For the Sales Manager tasked with solving a problem of poor sales in one region, or deciding the future focus of a sales drive, the raw
data needs to be processed into a sales report . It is the sales report that provides information .

- Collecting data is expensive

  - you need to be very clear about why you need it and how you plan to use it.
  - One of the main reasons that organisations collect data is to monitor and improve performance.
    - if you are to have the information you need for control and performance improvement, you need to:
      - collect data on the indicators that really do affect performance
      - collect data reliably and regularly
      - be able to convert data into the information you need.
 
- To be useful, data must satisfy a number of conditions. It must be:
  - relevant to the specific purpose
  - complete
  - accurate
  - timely
    - data that arrives after you have made your decision is of no value
  - in the right format
    - information can only be analysed using a spreadsheet if all the data can be entered into the computer system
  - available at a suitable price
    - the benefits of the data must merit the cost of collecting or buying it.

- The same criteria apply to information .
  - It is important
    - to get the right information
    - to get the information right
    
- Ultimately the tremendous amount of information that is generated is only useful if it can be applied to create knowledge within the
organisation.      

- There is considerable blurring and confusion between the terms information and knowledge .

- Think of knowledge as being of two types:
  - Formal, explicit or generally available knowledge.
    - This is knowledge that has been captured and used to develop policies and operating procedures for example.
  - Instinctive, subconscious, tacit or hidden knowledge.
    - Within the organisation there are certain people who hold specific knowledge or have the 'know how'
      >{"I did something very similar to that last year and this happened….."}

- Clearly, both types of knowledge are essential for the organisation.

- Information on its own will not create a knowledge-based organisation
>but it is a key building block.

- The right information fuels the development of intellectual capital
>which in turns drives innovation and performance
improvement.
